So, you’re done developing your app and it's time to submit it for review to go live on the in-game Appstore. First thing's first - Congratulations!

In this page we'll detail how you can submit your app and set yourself up for approval.

## Support page

Before your new app can go live, we recommend create a customer support page for it. We've put together advice and instructions on building support pages for your app [here](add-a-knowledge-base-to-app).

## How to Submit an App

* Please take the time to [validate your manifest](../api/validate-your-manifest) before submitting your app for review.
* Compress all of the images/assets to reduce the final app size. You can use https://tinypng.com/ free service to compress the images.
* **Make sure you have all of the following items zipped in this structure when you send it to us:**

### 3. ScreenshotX.jpg
